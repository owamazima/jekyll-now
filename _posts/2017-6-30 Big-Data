#### BIG-DATA
### Introduction
Big data is a blanket term for the non-traditional strategies and technologies needed to gather, organize, process, and gather insights from large datasets. While the problem of working with data that exceeds the computing power or storage of a single computer is not new, the pervasiveness, scale, and value of this type of computing has greatly expanded in recent years.

In this article, we will talk about big data on a fundamental level and define common concepts you might come across while researching the subject. We will also take a high-level look at some of the processes and technologies currently being used in this space.
