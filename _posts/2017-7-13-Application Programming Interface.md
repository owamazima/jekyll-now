<span style="color:red"> *An API Endpoint for UTAMU Students Results Query and Access*</span>
### _Introduction_
<div style="text-align: justify"> _In computer programming, an Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of subroutine definitions, protocols, and tools for building application software. In general terms, it is a set of clearly defined methods of communication between various software components. A good API makes it easier to develop a computer program by providing all the building blocks, which are then put together by the programmer. An API may be for a web-based system, operating system, database system, computer hardware or software library. An API specification can take many forms, but often includes specifications for routines, data structures, object classes, variables or remote calls. POSIX, Microsoft Windows API, the C++Standard Template Library and Java APIs are examples of different forms of APIs. Documentation for the API is usually provided to facilitate usage_.</div>

### _A Guide to Designing and Building RESTful Web Service for Students Results Query and Access_
<div style="text-align: justify"> From the point of view of REST, a “real” Web service is a service designed to embrace the “Web” from the ground up. The Web has become the most successful distributed computing platform ever developed, thanks to years of investment and widespread usage. The Web platform includes concepts that you’re probably already familiar with like URIs, HTTP, and common data formats like XML, RSS/ATOM, and JSON. Ultimately, services that embrace these core concepts will immediately derive the valuable benefits they provide.
REST defines an architectural style based on a set of constraints for building things the “Web” way. REST is not tied to any particular technology or platform – it’s simply a way to design things to work like the Web. People often refer to services that follow this philosophy as “RESTful services.” In this blog, i covered  the fundamental REST design principles and considerations show you how to build RESTful services for Students Results Query and Access with Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), the WCF REST Starter Kit, and ADO.NET Data Services. </div>

### _The Web Platform_
<div style="text-align: justify">Before immersing ourselves in the world of REST, we should review the essence of the Web platform as we know it today. We call it the “Web” because the architecture provides a framework for creating and navigating a Web of resources. A resource could be anything. Some resources are simply data like files, images, or videos while others are temporal services that produce dynamic output (e.g., Pluralsight’s upcoming course schedule). Some services even run complex algorithms behind the scenes. You can think of the Web as a resource-oriented architecture for building large-scale distributed systems.</div>

### _Resource-Oriented Architecture_
<div style="text-align: justify">On the Web, every resource is given a unique identifier, also known as a universal resource identifier (URI). The most common type of URI used on the Web today is a uniform resource locator (URL). As an example, the URL – http://www.pluralsight.com/main/ilt/schedule.aspx – identifies and locates Pluralsight’s upcoming training course schedule, a popular resource made available on our site.
Since a given URI uniquely identifies a resource, it can be saved for future use and shared with others. For example, when you find a resource you want to get back to later, you can: try to remember it, write it down on a napkin, save it to disk (as a browser bookmark), or store it in a database of bookmarks on the Web, in which case the bookmark itself becomes a new Web resource. You can also share the resource with others by telling them the URI or emailing it to them so they can easily browse to it themselves. Many companies try hard to create easy-to-remember URIs that can be successfully conveyed via advertising and will hopefully spread via word-of-mouth. In the end, as long as you have the URI, you can enter it into a Web browser and retrieve the resource at some future point in time.
Now, the reason it’s called the “Web” is because resources can contain hyperlinks  to other resources, thereby creating a Web of resources. Hyperlinks make it possible to navigate from one resource to another by using the target resource URI. For example, in HTML you link to another resource through the anchor element. When a browser renders an anchor element, it provides a visual cue showing that you can click on the anchor text to issue a GET request for the target resource URI. Humans-in this case UTAMU students will play an important role in most Web applications because they’re the ones viewing the page, entering data in forms, and clicking links. Humans-(UTAMU Students) are really the client-side engine navigating the Web of resources.
When you retrieve a resource using a Web browser, you’re really retrieving a representation of that resource. This implies that there could be multiple representations of a particular resource. There are many standard and common formats used on the Web today to represent resources that virtually all browsers understand. One of the most common formats is (X)HTML but others are common as well, including JPEG and GIF, WMV and SWF, RSS and ATOM, CSS and JavaScript/JSON to name a few. When a browser receives one of these representations, it does its best to render it for human viewing.</div>
