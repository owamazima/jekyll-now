<span style="color:red"> *An API Endpoint for UTAMU Students Results Query and Access*</span>
### _Introduction_
<div style="text-align: justify"> _In computer programming, an Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of subroutine definitions, protocols, and tools for building application software. In general terms, it is a set of clearly defined methods of communication between various software components. A good API makes it easier to develop a computer program by providing all the building blocks, which are then put together by the programmer. An API may be for a web-based system, operating system, database system, computer hardware or software library. An API specification can take many forms, but often includes specifications for routines, data structures, object classes, variables or remote calls. POSIX, Microsoft Windows API, the C++Standard Template Library and Java APIs are examples of different forms of APIs. Documentation for the API is usually provided to facilitate usage_.</div>

#### _A Guide to Designing and Building RESTful Web Service for Students Results Query and Access_
<div style="text-align: justify"> From the point of view of REST, a “real” Web service is a service designed to embrace the “Web” from the ground up. The Web has become the most successful distributed computing platform ever developed, thanks to years of investment and widespread usage. The Web platform includes concepts that you’re probably already familiar with like URIs, HTTP, and common data formats like XML, RSS/ATOM, and JSON. Ultimately, services that embrace these core concepts will immediately derive the valuable benefits they provide.
REST defines an architectural style based on a set of constraints for building things the “Web” way. REST is not tied to any particular technology or platform – it’s simply a way to design things to work like the Web. People often refer to services that follow this philosophy as “RESTful services.” In this blog, i covered  the fundamental REST design principles and considerations show you how to build RESTful services for Students Results Query and Access with Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), the WCF REST Starter Kit, and ADO.NET Data Services. </div>
