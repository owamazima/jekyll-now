### _Introduction_
<div style="text-align: justify"> _In computer programming, an Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of subroutine definitions, protocols, and tools for building application software. In general terms, it is a set of clearly defined methods of communication between various software components. A good API makes it easier to develop a computer program by providing all the building blocks, which are then put together by the programmer. An API may be for a web-based system, operating system, database system, computer hardware or software library. An API specification can take many forms, but often includes specifications for routines, data structures, object classes, variables or remote calls. POSIX, Microsoft Windows API, the C++Standard Template Library and Java APIs are examples of different forms of APIs. Documentation for the API is usually provided to facilitate usage_.</div>

#### _Design_
<div style="text-align: justify"> The design of an API has significant impacts on its usability. The principle of information hiding describes the role of programming interfaces as enabling modular programming by hiding the implementation details of the modules so that users of modules need not understand the complexities inside the modules. Thus, the design of an API attempts to provide only the tools a user would expect. The design of programming interfaces represents an important part of software architecture, the organization of a complex piece of software. 
Several authors have created recommendations for how to design APIs, such as Joshua Bloch, Kin Lane, and Michi Henning.
