<span style="color:red">Mobile Computing</span>
<div style="text-align: justify"><span style="color:green">Mobile computing is human–computer interaction by which a computer is expected to be transported during normal usage, which allows for transmission of data, voice and video. Mobile computing involves mobile communication, mobile hardware, and mobile software. Communication issues include ad hoc networks and infrastructure networks as well as communication properties, protocols, data formats and concrete technologies. Hardware includes mobile devices or device components. Mobile software deals with the characteristics and requirements of mobile applications.</span><br>


<span style="color:red">Internet of Things (IoTs)</span>
<div style="text-align: justify"><span style="color:green">The Internet of things (IoT) is the inter-networking of physical devices, vehicles (also referred to as "connected devices" and "smart devices"), buildings, and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity which enable these objects to collect and exchange data.In 2013, the Global Standards Initiative on Internet of Things (IoT-GSI) defined the IoT as "a global infrastructure for the information society, enabling advanced services by interconnecting (physical and virtual) things based on existing and evolving interoperable information and communication technologies,"and for these purposes a "thing" is "an object of the physical world (physical things) or the information world (virtual things), which is capable of being identified and integrated into communication networks".The IoT allows objects to be sensed or controlled remotely across existing network infrastructure, creating opportunities for more direct integration of the physical world into computer-based systems, and resulting in improved efficiency, accuracy and economic benefit in addition to reduced human intervention. When IoT is augmented with sensors and actuators, the technology becomes an instance of the more general class of cyber-physical systems, which also encompasses technologies such as smart grids, virtual power plants, smart homes, intelligent transportation and smart cities. Each thing is uniquely identifiable through its embedded computing system but is able to interoperate within the existing Internet infrastructure. Experts estimate that the IoT will consist of about 30 billion objects by 2020.

Typically, IoT is expected to offer advanced connectivity of devices, systems, and services that goes beyond machine-to-machine (M2M) communications and covers a variety of protocols, domains, and applications.The interconnection of these embedded devices (including smart objects), is expected to usher in automation in nearly all fields, while also enabling advanced applications like a smart grid,and expanding to areas such as smart cities.

"Things", in the IoT sense, can refer to a wide variety of devices such as heart monitoring implants, biochip transponders on farm animals, electric clams in coastal waters, automobiles with built-in sensors, DNA analysis devices for environmental/food/pathogen monitoring, or field operation devices that assist firefighters in search and rescue operations. Legal scholars suggest regarding "Things" as an "inextricable mixture of hardware, software, data and service".

These devices collect useful data with the help of various existing technologies and then autonomously flow the data between other devices. Current market examples include home automation (also known as smart home devices) such as the control and automation of lighting, heating (like smart thermostat), ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC) systems, and appliances such as washer/dryers, robotic vacuums, air purifiers, ovens, or refrigerators/freezers that use Wi-Fi for remote monitoring.

As well as the expansion of Internet-connected automation into a plethora of new application areas, IoT is also expected to generate large amounts of data from diverse locations, with the consequent necessity for quick aggregation of the data, and an increase in the need to index, store, and process such data more effectively. IoT is one of the platforms of today's Smart City, and Smart Energy Management Systems.

The term "the Internet of Things" was coined by Kevin Ashton of Procter & Gamble, later MIT's Auto-ID Center, in 1999.</span></div>

## 5th generation mobile networks or 5th generation wireless systems, abbreviated 5G, are the proposed next telecommunications standards beyond the current 4G/IMT-Advanced standards.

<div style="text-align: justify">5G planning aims at higher capacity than current 4G, allowing a higher density of mobile broadband users, and supporting device-to-device, ultra reliable, and massive machine communications.

5G research and development also aims at lower latency than 4G equipment and lower battery consumption, for better implementation of the Internet of things.

There is currently no standard for 5G deployments.

The Next Generation Mobile Networks Alliance defines the following requirements that a 5G standard should fulfill:[2]

Data rates of tens of megabits per second for tens of thousands of users
Data rates of 100 megabits per second for metropolitan areas
1 Gb per second simultaneously to many workers on the same office floor
Several hundreds of thousands of simultaneous connections for wireless sensors
Spectral efficiency significantly enhanced compared to 4G
Coverage improved
Signalling efficiency enhanced
Latency reduced significantly compared to LTE.
In addition to providing simply faster speeds, they predict that 5G networks also will need to meet new use cases,[4] such as the Internet of Things (internet connected devices), as well as broadcast-like services and lifeline communication in times of natural disaster. Carriers, chipmakers, OEMS and OSATs, such as Advanced Semiconductor Engineering (ASE) and Amkor Technology, Inc., have been preparing for this next-generation (5G) wireless standard, as mobile systems and base stations will require new and faster application processors, basebands and RF devices.

Although updated standards that define capabilities beyond those defined in the current 4G standards are under consideration, those new capabilities have been grouped under the current ITU-T 4G standards. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the spectrum for 5G, including the 28 Gigahertz, 37 GHz and 39 GHz bands, on July 14, 2016.</div>

<span style="color:red">Mobile Computing</span>The IoT trends driving enterprise digital transformation</span>

<div style="text-align: justify">Enterprises are driving the Internet of Things transformation. Consumer products such as wearables and connected electronics certainly garner a large part of the market, but IDC estimates more than 80 percent of IoT spend through 2020 will be on B2B applications and use cases. The Internet of Things will be one of the primary drivers of the digital transformation that enterprises will undergo in the coming years, creating a self-learning environment that will drive digital disruption in physical world. IoT will be a critical piece of this transformation as it allows new business models to emerge and enables changes in work processes, productivity improvements, cost containment and enhanced customer experiences.</div>

<span style="color:red">APIs</span>

<div style="text-align: justify">Application programming interfaces (APIs) and a sound strategy around them is becoming increasingly important to enterprises tapping into the IoT. APIs serve as a bridge to connect useful information and plentiful data to the Internet of Things, making the Internet of Things useful by connecting many disparate things into a powerful network that offers astounding possibilities.

APIs are the market enabler, and Internet of Things devices would be useless without them. By exposing data that enables multiple devices to be connected, APIs provide an interface between the Internet and the things to reveal previously unseen possibilities. In the year to come, the power and importance of APIs will be at the forefront of the conversation around enabling—and more important—monetizing the Internet of Things.

IBM brings the power of cognition to the Internet of Things with Watson APIs. In a physical world in which devices and systems are becoming highly digitized, the capabilities provided by these APIs give IBM clients, partners and developers an ever fuller sense of the data on which they rely:

    The Natural Language Processing (NLP) API Family enables users to interact with systems and devices using simple, human language. Natural Language Processing helps solutions understand the intent of human language by correlating it with other sources of data to put it into context in specific situations.
    The Machine Learning Watson API Family automates data processing and continuously monitors new data and user interactions to rank data and results based on learned priorities. Machine Learning can be applied to any data coming from devices and sensors to automatically understand the current conditions, what’s normal, expected trends, properties to monitor, and suggested actions when an issue arises.
    The Video and Image Analytics API Family enables monitoring of unstructured data from video feeds and image snapshots to identify scenes and patterns. This knowledge can be combined with machine data to gain a greater understanding of past events and emerging situations.
    The Text Analytics API Family enables mining of unstructured textual data including transcripts from customer call centers, maintenance technician logs, blog comments, and tweets to find correlations and patterns in these vast amounts of data.</div>


<span style="color:red">Security</span>

<div style="text-align: justify">As we rely on connected devices to make our lives better and easier, security must be considered from every aspect. All participants in the IoT ecosystem have a responsibility for the security of the devices, data and solutions. This means that device manufacturers, application developers, consumers, operators, integrators and enterprise businesses all have their part to play to follow best practices.

IoT security requires a multi-layered approach. From a device point of view it should be considered at the blueprint level that starts with design and development and keeps hardware, firmware/software, and data secure through their entire life. The same approach applies if you are a security analyst or operations personnel responsible for IoT solutions. To enable the full potential of IoT, security challenges must be addressed through a combination of interoperability, education and good design—and by taking a proactive, not reactive approach to designing security features, which will result in better products and solutions.

Understanding the intricacies of IoT and the security around it is something that we at IBM have taken very seriously. We have invested and combined the expertise from across the IBM business incorporating thought leaders from IBM Research, Security and IoT to provide a comprehensive overview of IoT Security. In our latest POV on cognitive security for the Internet of Things, we share with the whole IoT community in a bid to disseminate ideas and best practices.  In addition, we continue to work with various organizations who are researching and publishing recommendations on IoT and security including the Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC) and IoT Security Foundation (IoTSF).
Platforms

IoT platforms received a great amount of attention in 2016 as most major IoT players rolled one out in one form or another. Platforms that have the right elements can provide tremendous value by linking the IoT endpoints to the applications and analytics needed to generate business outcomes. It’s the linchpin in a holistic IoT solution as it enables the data generated at the endpoints to be processed and meaningfully used by end users.

An IoT platform must connect devices, must collect data, must handle thousands of vendors, dozens of standards and must be able to scale to millions of devices sending billions of messages. To deliver true value beyond the basics, it must add cognitive, security, privacy, insight generation and close loop automation. With these capabilities and the supporting technology advancements, the IoT platform becomes an agent of transformation for a business.

The recently published report, The Forrester Wave™: IoT Software Platforms, Q4 2016 assessed how the leading IoT platforms stack up against each other based on current offerings, strategy and market presence. I invite you to read the report to see how IBM’s investment in this technology for the past ten years, combined with new capabilities, has placed us as a leader among IoT platform vendors.
Cognitive Computing

The Internet of Things is at the threshold of a tremendous opportunity. Connecting things with unique IP addresses has been possible for over a decade, but the commoditization of sensors, processors and memory now make it viable to make everyday things move beyond being just connected, but actually making them intelligent.

Beyond traditional IoT implementations, cognitive computing is increasing the amount of data to improve the learning environment and increase the possibilities of what can be done with edge analytics – making sensors capable of diagnosing and adapting to their environment without the need for human intervention. Another huge advantage of cognitive IoT is the ability to combine multiple data streams that can identify patterns and give much more context than would be otherwise available.

Cognitive IoT, AI and machine learning are further enabling enterprises to unlock IoT value. An exploding amount of IoT data requires a new approach to gather, analyze and makes sense out of all that data. Such a massive amount of information from sensors and devices can be used to enhance existing data and knowledge, uncovering insights capable of transforming industries. But although making sense out of dark data and edge data is paving our way to revolutionary ideas and technologies, it requires a cognitive approach that can effectively handle increasingly large inputs while generating meaningful output. Programmable systems thrive on prescribed scenarios using predictable data, and their rigidity can limit their usefulness when addressing the ambiguity and uncertainty of IoT data. Cognitive systems, however, are not explicitly programmed. Rather, they learn from interactions with people and from experiences with their environment. In doing so, they become able to keep pace with the complexity of the Internet of things, identifying data correlations that would otherwise go unnoticed.
Blockchain

Blockchain is playing a major part in the Internet of Things by enhancing security, making transactions more seamless and creating efficiencies in the supply chain.

I expect the coming year will be one in which we see companies start to leverage blockchain in 3 key ways:

    Build trust –  blockchain can help build trust between the people and parties that transact together. Watson IoT blockchain enables devices to participate in blockchain transactions as a trusted party.  While Person A may not know device B and may not trust it implicitly, the indelible record of transactions and data from devices stored on the blockchain provide proof and command the necessary trust for businesses and people to cooperate.
    Reduce costs – IoT and blockchain can enable participants to reduce monetary and time commitment costs by ultimately removing the “middle man” from the process. Transactions and device data are now exhibited on a peer to peer basis, removing most legal or contractual costs.
    Accelerate transactions – IoT and blockchain enables more transactions overall because the “middle man” is removed from the process. Smart contracts allow for organizations to reduce time needed for completing legal or contractual commitments.

Blockchain for IoT can transform the way business transactions are conducted globally through a trustworthy environment to automate and encode business transactions while preserving enterprise level privacy and security for all parties in the transaction. IBM Watson IoT Blockchain utilizes blockchain capabilities and enables information from IoT devices to be used in transactions. This allows IoT devices to be used in building blockchain-based solutions to help organizations improve operational efficiency, transform customer experience, and adopt new business models in a secure, private, and decentralized manner, so all participating organizations gain value.

I expect these 5 things to play a major role in enterprise IoT in 2017 and beyond the coming year. I also expect to see many things we aren’t currently thinking about emerge in the next year as the IoT is evolving so rapidly that there is always something new. </div>
