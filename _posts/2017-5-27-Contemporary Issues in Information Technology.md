# THE GENESIS AND NATURE OF RANSOMWARE
### Introduction 
 It may be difficult to imagine, but the first ransomware in history emerged in 1989 (thatâ€™s 27 years ago). It was called the AIDS Trojan, whose modus operandi seems crude nowadays. It spread via floppy disks and involved sending $189 to a post office box in Panama to pay the ransom.
As cyber criminals moved from cyber vandalism to cyber-crime as a business, ransomware emerged as the go-to malware to feed the money-making machine.
The advent of Bitcoin and evolution of encryption algorithms favoured made the context ripe for ransomware development too.

Ransomware is a form of malware (malicious software, malware refers to software designed specifically to damage or disrupt a system, such as a virus or a Trojan horse)  in which rogue software code (Also called smitfraud, scareware, or rogue security software, this type of software is defined as malware - it is designed specifically to damage or disrupt a computer system. In this case, not only is the software going to disrupt your system, it's going to try and trick you into making a purchase using your credit card) effectively holds a user's computer hostage until a "ransom" fee is paid. Ransomware often infiltrates a PC as a computer worm or Trojan that takes advantage of open security vulnerabilities. Most ransomware attacks are the result of clicking on an infected email attachment or visiting hacked or malicious websites.
Upon compromising a computer, ransomware will typically either lock a user's system or encrypt (The translation of data into a secret code) files on the computer and then demand payment before the system or files will be restored
