#### THE GENESIS AND NATURE OF RANSOMWARE
### Introduction 
 It may be difficult to imagine, but the first ransomware in history emerged in 1989 (that’s 27 years ago). It was called the AIDS Trojan, whose modus operandi seems crude nowadays. It spread via floppy disks and involved sending $189 to a post office box in Panama to pay the ransom.
As cyber criminals moved from cyber vandalism to cyber-crime as a business, ransomware emerged as the go-to malware to feed the money-making machine.
The advent of Bitcoin and evolution of encryption algorithms favoured made the context ripe for ransomware development too.
This graph shows just how many types of encrypting malware researchers have discovered in the past 10 years.

Ransomware is a form of malware (malicious software, malware refers to software designed specifically to damage or disrupt a system, such as a virus or a Trojan horse)  in which rogue software code (Also called smitfraud, scareware, or rogue security software, this type of software is defined as malware - it is designed specifically to damage or disrupt a computer system. In this case, not only is the software going to disrupt your system, it's going to try and trick you into making a purchase using your credit card) effectively holds a user's computer hostage until a "ransom" fee is paid. Ransomware often infiltrates a PC as a computer worm or Trojan that takes advantage of open security vulnerabilities. Most ransomware attacks are the result of clicking on an infected email attachment or visiting hacked or malicious websites.
Upon compromising a computer, ransomware will typically either lock a user's system or encrypt (The translation of data into a secret code) files on the computer and then demand payment before the system or files will be restored

### General Technical Aspects of An Attack
And keep in mind 3 things, so you can get a sense of how big the issue really is:
•	There are numerous variants for each type (for example, CrytpoWall is on its 4th version)
•	No one can map all the existing ransomware out there (because most ransomware attacks go unreported);
•	New ransomware is coming out in volumes at an ever-increasing pace.

### What group of hacking attacks are this /who is behind the attack?
It's unclear who the attackers are, but we do somewhat know about the origins of the ransomware. The vulnerability in Windows that WannaCry takes advantage of was discovered by the NSA for its surveillance toolkit. But word got out when a hacker group known as the Shadow Brokers dumped a bunch of leaked NSA information onto the Internet in April. Microsoft, however, had already issued a software update the month before; those that downloaded and installed the patch were protected from WannaCry, but many others lagged behind and became victims.
Microsoft is now warning that the government practice of “stockpiling” software vulnerabilities so that they can be used as weapons is a misguided tactic that weakens security for everybody.
“An equivalent scenario with conventional weapons would be the U.S. military having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen,” the company said Sunday.
More still 
###### BEIJING -- Technology experts say the threat of another global cyber-attack continues Tuesday morning, and they say there's evidence North Korean hackers could be behind the massive malware assault that paralyzed computer systems world-wide last week.
Just as North Korea boasted about the successful launch of a new missile it says can carry a "large" nuclear warhead, technology experts said they had found evidence buried deep in computer code that North Korean hackers could be behind the digital international threat, too.
Cyber security firms have found similarities between the tools used in this attack and those used in previous hacks blamed on North Korea.
The hacking tools were first developed by the National Security Agency but were stolen and leaked, and now they may have been used by a North Korean hacking group.
"In this case, there is a fragment of the technology that was associated with Lazarus," Gregory Clark, CEO of cyber security firm Symantec, told CBS News.   
"The Lazurus Group" is a hacker collective with ties to North Korea, and experts at Symantec and other companies say they found a portion of the group's previous malware coding inside the "WannaCry" hacking program used in last week's cyberattacks.
The discovery was made by a Google security researcher, Neel Mehta, who pointed it out in a cryptic tweet on Monday the parallel between an early version of the WannaCry tool used last week and code used by Lazurus in several years ago.

### Some of the Other Examples like The Ransomeware Attack
##### CryptoLocker
This is the ransomware that showed all the other cyber toe rags how to do it in 2013. The malware propagates via infected email attachments, encrypting particular classes of files stored locally and on mounted network drives using RSA public-key cryptography. The private key is stored on the malware's control servers, to which it connects when activated.
#### Petya
Petya was defeated in April when a kind soul released an algorithm that can generate decryption passwords, but before that it was a thoroughly unpleasant piece of ransomware.
Instead of encrypting files one by one and then presenting the unfortunate user with a nasty extortion demand, Petya attacked the low-level structures on the disk.
#### Dogspectus
It isn't just Windows PCs that are at risk of ransomware. Smartphones are increasingly being targeted, regardless of the more walled garden nature of mobile operating systems.
Dogspectus, according to security company Blue Coat Systems, targets ageing Android devices and can infect with no user stupidity required.
 #### CryptXXX 3.0
Ransomware is now being bundled into exploit kits, and security researchers tend to keep track not only of the botnets that propagate malware, but the exploit kits used by cyber scammers.

### The Ethical Aspects Related to this Attack
IT security professionals have a challenging job when it comes to cyber-security. Not only must they guard against attacks but they also must contend with ethical issues. Most businesses have an official policy regarding privacy and other ethical issues. However, security personnel must often make decisions on a case-by-case basis. Most of the leading issues that pertain to the ethics of cyber-security concern privacy. This includes actions such as:

•	Reading private emails.
•	Monitoring social media activity.
•	Capturing the keystrokes of everything employees type.
•	Reading files stored on employees’ machines.
Companies may have the legal right to do these and other things in the name of security. The question is, does that make it ethical to do so? Another question is whether businesses should inform their employees about such policies. Technically, employees sign contracts that waive their rights to privacy. In practice, however, people are not usually expecting others to read what they assume are private communications.

There are also issues related to what you do with the information you gather. When employees violate blatant rules such as sharing confidential information, it’s certainly justifiable to take actions such as disciplining or terminating them. However, when employees’ communications are monitored, more nuanced issues often arise. For example, is it fair to terminate employees who make negative remarks about the company in their emails?
In addition to issues related to companies and their employees, there are also other cyber-security issues to consider. The recent iPhone battle between Apple and the FBI is an example of another big question. Does the government have the right to demand that companies turn over data in the name of national security?
There are no simple answers to these questions. As both hackers and security professionals get more sophisticated, it’s increasingly important to address these core issues related to cyber-security. Both businesses and governments must find ways to balance security with ethics and privacy concerns.
Some Mitigation Aspects for Organizations That Can Be Affected
On the one hand, ransomware can be very scary – the encrypted files can essentially be considered damaged beyond repair. But if you have properly prepared your system, it is really nothing more than a nuisance. Here are a few tips that will help you keep ransomware from wrecking your day:

 #### Back up your data

The single biggest thing that will defeat ransomware is having a regularly updated backup. If you are attacked with ransomware you may lose that document you started earlier this morning, but if you can restore your system to an earlier snapshot or clean up your machine and restore your other lost documents from backup, you can rest easy. Remember that Cryptolocker will also encrypt files on drives that are mapped. This includes any external drives such as a USB thumb drive, as well as any network or cloud file stores that you have assigned a drive letter. So, what you need is a regular backup regimen, to an external drive or backup service, one that is not assigned a drive letter or is disconnected when it is not doing backup.
The next three tips are meant to deal with how Cryptolocker has been behaving – this may not be the case forever, but these tips can help increase your overall security in small ways that help prevent against a number of different common malware techniques.
#### Show hidden file-extensions

One way that Cryptolocker frequently arrives is in a file that is named with the extension “.PDF.EXE”, counting on Window’s default behavior of hiding known file-extensions. If you re-enable the ability to see the full file-extension, it can be easier to spot suspicious files.
 #### Filter EXEs in email

If your gateway mail scanner has the ability to filter files by extension, you may wish to deny mails sent with “.EXE” files, or to deny mails sent with files that have two file extensions, the last one being executable (“*.*.EXE” files, in filter-speak). If you do legitimately need to exchange executable files within your environment and are denying emails with “.EXE” files, you can do so with ZIP files (password-protected, of course) or via cloud services.
#### Disable files running from AppData/LocalAppData folders

You can create rules within Windows or with Intrusion Prevention Software, to disallow a particular, notable behavior used by Cryptolocker, which is to run its executable from the App Data or Local App Data folders. If (for some reason) you have legitimate software that you know is set to run not from the usual Program Files area but the App Data area, you will need to exclude it from this rule.

 #### Use the Cryptolocker Prevention Kit

The Cryptolocker Prevention Kit is a tool created by Third Tier that automates the process of making a Group Policy to disable files running from the App Data and Local App Data folders, as well as disabling executable files from running from the Temp directory of various unzipping utilities. This tool is updated as new techniques are discovered for Cryptolocker, so you will want to check in periodically to make sure you have the latest version. If you need to create exemptions to these rules, they provide this document that explains that process.

### The General Outlook or Impact of This Attack 
#### Why Are Non-Profit Firms In Danger?
- Ransomware has become a global cybercrime issue with a high number of targets and victims. No business is exempt from this type of attack. Sector and size are not mitigating factors because attackers are usually purely motivated by money. Organized crime gangs often with an international reach lie behind many attacks and have the single aim of making money. If they can gain access to a system, they can exploit it using ransomware with the minimum of effort for financial profit.
- Of the 155,000 non-profits registered in the UK, 73% have an annual income of under £100,000. Of these, just fewer than 40% have an annual income of less than £10,000. Faced with this low level of funding, many simply do not have the time or financial resources to keep up-to-date with the latest cyber-security advice, wipe the hard drives of donated equipment, or in some cases even run background checks on volunteers or temporary staff.
- The UK Comic Relief non-profit, for example, was a target in October 2016 in an attack that forced the charity to take some of their systems off-line for several days while they remedied the situation by restoring backups and installing new security measures.
- Hospitals and universities have also recently been targeted by ransomware attacks. Out-law.com reported in February this year that 88 out of 260 health trusts in England, Scotland and Wales had experienced a ransomware attack. NHS trusts are a prized target because of the value of their data; hospitals need constant access to their patients’ records so will need to pay up or risk harming patients’ health.

### What can be done?
- The best defense is prevention. There are many layers of protective measures that will help to make an attack harder and reduce its impact. The second-best defense is to have response plans in place in order to react effectively without delay.
- In terms of prevention, routine and simple technical controls will make it significantly harder for attackers to succeed. We outline our recommendations for best practice at the end of this article.
- In terms of response plans, a workable and regularly tested incident management and response plan is also critical. Taking simple steps such as disconnecting devices from the network can often prevent more damage being done. These plans should also include a strategy to manage communications with the media and customers in the event of an attack.
- The Charity Commission has in recent years consolidated its role as regulator to ensure non-profits have sufficient policies in place which are effectively communicated to and understood by staff and trustees. Given the constraints of time and money, however, producing, implementing, and updating these can place a substantial burden on non-profits that may be perceived as less important than the organization’s core work.
- The ICO also issued guidance in December 2016, noting that in the case of an attack resulting in a data loss, the ICO’s investigators would need to decide whether appropriate measures had been in place that could have prevented the attack from succeeding. They also signpost organizations to other resources such as the Government’s Cyber Essentialsaccreditation scheme and guidance from the National Cyber Security Centre.
- There is no obligation under current Data Protection regulations to notify the ICO of an attack. This situation will, however, change in May 2018 when the new General Data Protection Regulations are introduced. After this, non-profits and other organizations will have 72 hours within which to notify the ICO of breaches. Failure to do so is likely to result in financial penalties and condemnation. The ICO is widely expected to impose more lenient penalties on organizations that can demonstrate they had plans in place. It is therefore crucial to take steps now to introduce simple cybersecurity measures and put plans in place and test them well ahead of time.
- For organizations with larger budgets, there are many security products on the market. These solutions are costly as they provide off-site backups in three different geographical locations. Kaspersky provides reputable anti-virus software that ranked as one of the best solutions. Staff should be trained and tested by a contractor for a social engineering test, with companies such as Rapid7 or LIFARS.

### Conclusions and Recommendations
The increasing prevalence of ransomware cyber-attacks has heightened awareness and made cyber security a more urgent issue for a wider range of businesses. The impact is particularly severe because of their ability to affect multiple devices silently and speedily. Even with backups available, the clean-up operation takes time and has an associated cost. Even where protective measures are in place, the time spent restoring data and devices is a financial loss to the business.
In conclusion, we recommend organizations act in a timely manner to respond effectively to the threat of ransomware and to address the risks to the organization. We recommend the following minimum technical measures:
- Up-to-date antivirus software should be installed across all endpoints (devices with network or internet access). In addition, a multi-faceted security solution that provides heuristics, firewalls, and advanced behavioral-based threat prevention in a set of protection rules should be used. In addition, Data Leakage Prevention (DLP) and anomaly detection should be established.
- 	Applying an extensive global patch management system in which all desktop clients are completely patched.
- 	Regular and off-site backup of data.
-  Providing training and awareness programmes for employees and restricting administrative rights. Consider developing an incentive policy to encourage people to report anomalies and behave responsibly.
